# Complex Numbers - Operator Overloading
Operator overloading concepts in OOP.

## Problem Statement

Design a class of Complex Number having default, overloaded and copy constructors. Define all setter and getter functions. Also perform operator overloading as follows:

  * Overload the addition, subtraction, multiplication and division operators for this class.
  * Overload the equality and non-equality operators for this class.
  * Overload the unary operators such as negation, conjugate, pre & post increment/decrement
  * Write the function operator to convert Complex number to double type.
  * Write a type conversion constructor to convert a string into Complex number.
